# -Error-Detection-and-Correction-Techniques-in-Computer-Networks-using-Python
This project demonstrates error detection and correction in computer networks using Python. It simulates data transmission with noise using parity bits, checksums, CRC, and Hamming codes to detect and correct errors, showing how error control ensures reliable communication.
